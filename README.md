# Project 1 Issue Tracker

This repo allows our users to report issues, track upcoming features and suggest improvements with our game.

A few rules about reporting issues:
<ul>
  <li> Please do not use any offensive language
  <li> If an issue has been reported already please do not create duplicates
  <li> Provide as much detail as possible to help our team when reading your proposal / report (in the case of bug reports any suporting files are also helpful)
</ul>
